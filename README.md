# Overview
Treeglet is a library meant to make managing GUI easier in Pyglet. It uses the Pyglet `WidgetBase` class in pyglet/gui/widget.py as it's model in order to build the widget elements present in the library.

This library was heavily inspired by `glooey` and was made with the mindset of helping me using Pyglet more efficiently which can be noticed by the presence of **_unusual_**... code. Feel free to use and modify it to your liking.

This library was made to be compatible with my pyglet fork : https://github.com/onuelito/pyglet/tree/pyglet-1.6
